# elgentos/magento2-cypress-testing-suite
A community-driven Cypress testing suite for Magento 2

This testing suite was announced in [Peter Jaap](https://twitter.com/PeterJaap) his talk about [Cypress testing in Magento 2 at Reacticon 4](https://youtu.be/2zDliMebOqs?t=4435). Watch the talk for more information about Cypress testing.

You can see all runs of this testing suite in the [public Cypress Dashboard for this project](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/8vuidn). See for example [this succesfull run](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/8vuidn/runs/e0a3cf9c-9653-4b03-97cc-04178dd6adb8/test-results/044b4dba-9ee4-43ec-8db0-6fcf12c95df5).

## Prerequisites
- Magento 2.3.x / 2.4.x
- [Hyvä](https://hyva.io) (1.1.17) or Luma-based theme
- `npm`
- An admin bearer token (see [Setup](#setup))


## Assumptions & limitations

### Assumptions
- Magento 2 runs in Single Store Mode
- Default language is English
- Viewport is 1920x1280, with support for mobile viewports
- Sample Data is installed

- [Multi Source Inventory is not used](https://github.com/magento/inventory)

### Not plug & play
This test suite is _not_ plug & play for your store. A number of tests rely on Magento's default sample data. These tests will fail when you don't have the sample data. It is up to you to change the fixtures/selectors/tests to make them pass for your store.

### Open source-only right now
We don't do Commerce builds over at elgentos, so we haven't spent time creating tests for Commerce-only functionality.

### No 100% test coverage
We do not particularly strive for 100% test coverage. We have identified the most common and most revenue-dependent scenarios. For example, we do test viewing products, filtering categories, adding products to the cart etc, but we (currently) do not test the [Email a Friend](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/email-a-friend.html) or [Compare Products](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/product-compare.html) feature since these are rarely used in an average Magento store. We are perfectly willing to merge a PR with these tests of course.

### No extensibility / inheritance of tests
You need to copy the whole suite into your project. We are open to suggestions on how to solve this, see [Discussions](https://github.com/elgentos/magento2-cypress-testing-suite/discussions).

### The Hyvä checkout tests assume the React Checkout is used
The Hyvä checkout tests assume the [Hyvä React Checkout](https://github.com/hyva-themes/magento2-react-checkout). To skip checkout related Hyvä tests, set the environment variable `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_SKIP_CHECKOUT`.    
PR's are definitely welcome to improve the checkout related tests.

## Progress
We are at 76%; 65 out of the proposed 86 tests are done.

Wording & naming are subject to change.

## Installation
First, install Cypress and the dependencies in the root of your Magento 2 project:

```bash
npm ci
```

The easiest way to install the tests is to clone this repository and move the `cypress` folder into your project. As of right now, we do not provide a fallback mechanism for customizations to the tests, see [Limitations](https://github.com/elgentos/magento2-cypress-testing-suite/blob/main/README.md#no-extensibility--inheritance-of-tests).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:elgentos/magento2-cypress-testing-suite.git 
mv magento2-cypress-testing-suite/cypress .
mv magento2-cypress-testing-suite/cypress.config.js .
rm -rf magento2-cypress-testing-suite
```

If you only need the Hyvä tests:

```
rm -rf cypress/{fixtures,page-objects,integration}/luma
```

If you only need the Luma tests;

```
rm -rf cypress/{fixtures,page-objects,integration}/hyva
```

Then edit the `cypress.config.js` file in the root of your project to update your baseUrl and possibly some other defaults we've set:

```js
const baseUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === "develop" ? "http://cypress.magento2.localhost" : "https://example.com/";
```

Also add these lines to your `.gitignore` to avoid cluttering your Git repo;

```
node_modules
cypress/screenshots
cypress/videos
cypress.env.json
```

## Setup
Some tests are dependent on making changes in the database. This is done through the Magento 2 REST API. You will need to create an admin token for these tests. This is easily done using [magerun2](https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun2).

Get a list of all the admin users: `magerun2 admin:user:list`

If you don't have any admin users, create one; `magerun2 admin:user:create --admin-user=john --admin-firstname=John --admin-lastname=Doe --admin-password=JohnDoe123 --admin-email="john@example.com"`

Then create a token: `magerun2 admin:token:create username_goes_here`

You then can add the token to `cypress.env.json` as an environment variable:

```json
{
  "MAGENTO2_ADMIN_TOKEN": "token_goes_here"
}
```

Alternatively you can set it in your CI/CD variables by prefixing the environment variable name with `CYPRESS_`: `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_ADMIN_TOKEN: <token_goes_here>`.

### Tags
We use [tags](https://github.com/annaet/cypress-tags) to discern between hot tests and cold tests. If you followed the installation instructions above the `cypress-tags` module is already installed.  
Note: it is used in the `cypress.config.js` file in the `setupNodeEvents` callback.

## Running
```bash
npx cypress run
# npx cypress open # if you want to use the GUI
```

Individual specs can be run using the following [command](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#Commands):

```bash
npx cypress run --spec ./cypress/integration/path/to/some.spec.js
```

Hot and cold tests based on tags can be run using the following command:

```bash
CYPRESS_INCLUDE_TAGS=hot npx cypress run
```

### Running against local environment
Set up your local base URL in `cypress.config.js`, or export `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_BASE_URL`.  
Then run Cypress with `NODE_ENV=develop; npx cypress run`.

### Environment variables
Even though the test suite is intended to become part of a project, it is possible to change some behavior using environment variables.  
This is useful for running the suite in different environments, for example, development, CI, or against production.

* `NODE_ENV` if set to `develop` the development base URL configured in `cypress.config.js` will be used, and the default timeout is set to 10 seconds
* `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_BASE_URL` If set, this value will be used as the Magento 2 base_url. Otherwise, the base URL from `cypress.config.js` will be used.
* `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_SPEC_PATTERN` If set, only tests matching this glob pattern will be executed. Otherwise, the tests configured in `cypress.config.js` will be used.
* `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_EXPORT_PATTERN` If set, tests matching this glob pattern will be excluded.
* `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` If set, used as the default timeout. Otherwise, the timeout defaults to 10 seconds if NODE_ENV is set to `develop`, or 4 seconds otherwise. 
* `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_ADMIN_TOKEN` Used to authenticate against the Magento 2 API for setting up test fixtures.
* `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_SKIP_CHECKOUT` Set to a truthy value to skip any Hyvä tests that assume a Checkout is installed.
* `CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_SPEC_SUITE` Set the test suite to run, if not set defaults to `luma` or `hyva` depending on response headers.
* `CYPRESS_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` Set the currency symbol to use for matching prices (defaults to `$`).

Any of these can also be configured in a `cypress.env.json` file without the `CYPRESS_` prefix.

### Running tests from modules

Spec files in extensions will be found by the default spec pattern at

* `app/code/**/Test/Cypress/hyva/**/*.spec.js` or `app/code/**/Test/Cypress/luma/**/*.spec.js`
* `vendor/**/Test/Cypress/hyva/**/*.spec.js` or `vendor/**/Test/Cypress/luma/**/*.spec.js`

Tests for different frontends can be supplied by using a different folder in `Test/Cypress` and setting the `MAGENTO2_SPEC_SUITE` config to that name.
For example: `app/code/Example/Module/Test/Cypress/vue/user/account.spec.js` would be found by

```sh
CYPRESS_MAGENTO2_SPEC_SUITE=vue npx cypress run
```

If you do not want all tests to be run, regardless of the folder names, set `MAGENTO2_SPEC_SUITE` to an empty string.

## Contributing
We are very open to contributions! We would love to have mobile viewport support for Hyvä, tests for Commerce functionality, additional tests, code improvements, a fallback mechanism, etcetera etcetera. See the Issues tab for issues to pick up. 

We will be updating this readme soon with extensive contribution guidelines, but here is a short summary:
- Avoid creating global `cy` functions ([Custom Commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands)), instead put functions in utils/helpers and import them
- Avoid creating [aliases](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases#Aliases) that are only used once
- Use `cy.get()` as much as possible, only use `cy.contains()` in specific cases - try to avoid it
- Do not add assertions to page objects, move those to the spec files. Red flag; `should()` in a page object
- Every test (an `it()` function) has to be able to run stand-alone; it should not depend on any other test. You can test this by add `.only` (see [Cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Excluding-and-Including-Tests)).
